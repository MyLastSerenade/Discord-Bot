Discord Bot
My Discord Bot, i did this project to learn some Javascript and webscraping

following commands are integrated (will only mention the important commands):
$btc = current value of 1 Bitcoin in EUR
$dn/$hs/$mg/$la/$lip/$gk = will scrape corona-in-zahlen.de for the 7-day-incidence-rate (only updates once per day)
$rnd = will scrap a random prnt.sc/ page and give back a viable screenshot link (skips empty links)

web scraping is dont with puppeteer, api calls are made with axios
